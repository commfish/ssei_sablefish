## Commercial Fishery Development and History
State managed fisheries currently occur in NSEI (Chatham Strait) and SSEI (Clarence Strait and adjacent waters of Dixon Entrance). Sablefish have been harvested in the internal waters of Southeast Alaska since the early 1900s. Prior to the 1940s, sablefish were primarily landed as bycatch in the halibut fishery. Halibut longline gear was modified in the late 1940s to target sablefish. Unitl the 1970s, harvest levels fluctuated widely due to low price and better opportunities in other fisheries. Pot gear was first introduced in 1970 in Clarence Strait and Dixon Entrance areas and the pot fishery accounted for 33% of the total harvest in the early 1970s. In 1981, the NSEI fishery was restricted to longline gear only, but pot gear was still allowed in the SSEI subdistrict.

Sablefish have been historically managed with limitations on fishing seasons and harvest levels. Season limitations were first imposed in 1945 for the NSEI management area and in 1982 for the SSEI management area. Fishing seasons continued to be shortened in both areas as effort escalated in the 1970s and 1980s. GHRs based on historic catches were established for both areas in 1980. In 1985, a limited entry program was implemented for both the NSEI and SSEI sablefish fisheries. However, the number of vessels and overall operating efficiency of the longline fleet increased significantly after the limited entry program was implemented. In order to stay within GHRs, the department continued to reduce the number of fishing days in both areas. In the NSEI area, the number of fishing days fell from 76 days in 1980 to one day in 1987. One-day openings continued in the NSEI area through 1993. In 1993, the NSEI fleet harvested 3,640,000 dressed lb, which was 2,140,000 dressed lb over the upper bound of the GHR (1,500,000 dressed lb). In an effort to improve management, the board adopted an equal quota share (EQS) system for the NSEI area in 1994. In SSEI, the number of fishing days declined from 200 days in 1980 to 2 days in 1996 (Table 13). In 1997, at the request of industry,the board adopted a similar EQS system for the SSEI fishery and established separate seasons for the longline and pot fisheries to reduce gear conflicts.

## Area Description 
The Southern Southeast Inside (SSEI) Subdistrict management area consists of all waters as defined in 5 AAC 28.105 (a)(1) (Figure 1).

## SSEI Overview
The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (department) evaluates stock status and establishes the SSEI annual harvest objective (AHO) using commercial fishery and longline survey catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data, fishery and survey biological data (age, weight, length), and stock status trends of sablefish in surrounding geographic areas, which are summarized below. No abundance estimate is obtained for the SSEI stock. 

## Legal Gear 
Sablefish may be taken in the directed SSEI sablefish fishery only by longline and pots. CFEC limited entry C61C permits can use both longline and pot gear while C91C permits are restricted to the use of pot gear only. Groundfish pot gear requires individual tunnel eye openings with perimeters 36 inches or less and a sidewall containing an escapement opening equal to or exceeding 18 inches in length that must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of untreated, 100-percent cotton twine, no larger than 30 thread of which may be knotted at each end only and must be parallel to and within six inches of the bottom of the pot [5 AAC 39.145 (1)]. Pots must have at least two circular escape rings, with a minimum inside diameter of four inches, installed on opposing vertical or sloping walls of the pot. King and Tanner crab pots as described in 5 AAC 34.050 (2) and 5 AAC 35.050 (2) may not be used to take groundfish.

## Registration and Logbook Requirements
Fishermen must register prior to fishing [5 AAC 28.106 (b)] and keep a logbook during the fishery. Completed logbook pages must be attached to the ADF&G copy of the fish ticket at the time of delivery. Confidential envelopes for logbook pages may be requested when registering.

Permit holders will receive a personal quota share (PQS) tracking form at the time of registration. This form is used to record the total round weight landed for each delivery. Each permit holder must, upon request, provide the buyer with the total round weight of sablefish the permit holder has landed to date. The department requests that a copy of the completed PQS tracking form is included with the final fish ticket of the season for that permit.
Logbooks must include, by set, the date and time gear is set and retrieved, specific location of harvest by latitude and longitude in degrees and decimal minutes for start and ending positions, hook and pot spacing, amount of gear (number of hooks or pots), depth of set, estimated weight of the target and bycatch species retained or discarded. Indicate for each set if the target species was sablefish or halibut and if there was any lost gear [5 AAC 28.175 (a)].

## Fish Ticket Requirements 
Landed weights must be recorded on a fish ticket at the time of delivery. If a fisherman delivers fish in the round, the total round weight delivered must be recorded on the fish ticket. If a fisherman delivers dressed fish, the fish ticket must include the total landed dressed weight as well as the round weight equivalent, determined by using the standard 0.63 recovery rate. There is a 2% allowance for ice and slime when unrinsed whole iced sablefish are weighed. A fish ticket must be completed prior to the resumption of fishing and each permit holder must retain, on board their vessel, copies of all SSEI sablefish tickets from the current season and their updated PQS tracking form. When delivering fish out of state, a completed fish ticket must be submitted to ADF&G prior to transporting fish out of Alaska.

## Possession and Landing Requirements
The holder of a CFEC permit or interim use permit for sablefish may not retain more sablefish in the directed fishery than the annual amount of sablefish EQS specified by the department [5 AAC 28.170 (g)]. However, if a permit holder’s harvest exceeds the permit holder's EQS for that year, by not more than five percent, the department shall reduce the permit holder's EQS for the following year by the amount of the overage. If a permit holder's harvest exceeds the permit holder's EQS by more than five percent, the proceeds from the sale of the overage in excess of five percent shall be surrendered to the state, and the permit holder may be prosecuted under AS 16.05.723. A permit holder may not knowingly exceed a quota share or exceed the EQS in an amount greater than five percent as such actions may be prosecuted under AS 16.05.722 or AS 16.05.723 [5 AAC 28.170 (j)].

If a permit holder’s harvest is less than the permit holder’s EQS for that year, the department shall increase the permit holder’s EQS only for the following year by the amount of the underage that does not exceed five percent of the EQS [5 AAC 28.170 (k)]. 

## Sablefish Live Market
A permit holder may possess live sablefish for delivery as live product except that, upon request of a local representative of the department or law enforcement, a permit holder must present sablefish for inspection and allow biological samples to be taken [5 AAC 28.170 (l)].

## Bycatch
Allowable bycatch that may be legally landed on an SSEI sablefish permit is listed in Table 2 and is based on round weight for both target and bycatch species. CFEC permit holders fishing for groundfish or halibut must retain, weigh, and report all rockfish taken in SSEI [5 AAC 28.171 (f)]. The full retention regulation does not apply to thornyhead rockfish. All rockfish in excess of allowable bycatch limits shall be reported as bycatch overage on the fish ticket. Any proceeds from the sale of excess rockfish shall be surrendered to the state.
When the directed Pacific cod fishery is open in SSEI, Pacific cod taken in excess of bycatch limits may be landed on the appropriate CFEC miscellaneous finfish permit.

## Prohibitions 
A vessel or a person on board a vessel from which commercial, subsistence, or personal use longline fishing gear was used to take fish in the SSEI area during the 72-hour period immediately before the start of the commercial SSEI sablefish fishery, or from which that gear will be used during the 24-hour period immediately after the closure of the SSEI sablefish fishery, may not participate in the taking of sablefish in SSEI during that open sablefish fishing period [5 AAC 28.180 (a)]. The operator of a fishing vessel may not take sablefish in SSEI while sablefish from another area are on board the vessel. Also, the operator of a vessel taking sablefish in SSEI shall unload and submit a completed fish ticket to the department before taking sablefish in another area [5 AAC 28.170 (a) and (b)].
